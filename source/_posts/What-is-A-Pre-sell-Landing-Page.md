## Pre-sell Page is a type of Landing Page

<sup>**Note:** Pre-sell landing can be also known as a pre-cart landing page, bridge page or advertorial.</sup>

A <u>**Pre-sell**</u> page is a Landing Page, but a <u>**Landing Page**</u> may not always be a Pre-sell page.

The difference is in the purpose and goal.

> Let's say you want a **bike**, now is it you want a <u>mountain bike</u> or <u>road bike</u>. You can still use both but are you being efficient? In a business, efficiency is one of the keys that you must try to achieve.

If you want to capture leads then you might want to ask for a **Lead Magnet Landing Page**.

On the other hand, a **Pre-sell Landing Page** purpose is to warm up the audience to prepare them for a sale. The ultimate purpose of a landing page is to ease them into your **Call to Action** (CTA).

## Paid Traffic Ads and Pre-sell Pages

If you are in a business of running things online and you are serious in generating a revenue then you need to start using pre-sell pages specially when you are running paid traffic ads.

According to this [article by unbounce](https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/pre-cart-landing-pages/):

> The average click-through rate (CTR) for an ecommerce search ad on Google is just 2.69%. Facebook isn’t any better, with a 0.09% CTR across all industries. It gets worse as only 2.81% of people who click your Google ad will take an action (like buying something) when they land on your website.

To put it simply, only a few people from your paid ads will click on it and only a fragment of that will take the action or convert to a sale. You just don't have the control over it except where the ad will take the customers to, that's when the **Pre-sell Page** comes in.

## Why do you need a Pre-sell Page

A simple reason is that **they work**.

Advertising firm [Tier 11](https://tiereleven.com/) claims an increase in ROAS by as much as [77% through Pre-sell pages](https://tiereleven.com/how-tier-11-increased-roas-77-and-nearly-doubled-sales-page-conversions-using-pre-sell-engagement-content/).

Of course it isn't just a simple trick. Pre-sell pages are designed to ease the friction, build a trust on your company and product and a big rule to consider is that **no hard-selling**.

> Help your customers buy into a product before they actually buy the product.

## What makes a good Pre-sell Page

There is no **one-size-fits-all** template for Pre-sell pages as you must take into consideration the audience of the product you are going to sell. But there are correlations that you can implement to achieve such purpose.

Here are five elements the [optinmonster](https://optinmonster.com/how-to-create-a-pre-sell-page/) is suggesting:

### 1. Use a strong headline

> A great headline is the first thing people see. It should be short, catchy, and match the tone of your brand. Plus, it never hurts to throw in some power words!

### 2. Relate to the targeted audience

> Does your audience come from mobile or desktop? Do they prefer videos or text? Do they drink Pepsi or Coke? Ok, that last one probably doesn’t matter, but you get the point. You need to know your audience and their preferences to make sure your pre-sell page can effectively communicate your message to them.

### 3. Built trust

> This is where social proof comes into play. People (80%) actually prefer social proof over advertising. Show the logos of companies that have been successful with your product or give direct testimonials. These small signals let your customers know you have a quality product and you’re a reliable authority on the topic at hand.

### 4. Create a simple, clear call to action

> Once your visitors reach the pre-sell page, they should be led to a single call to action. For many SaaS companies, that would be a “Try It Now” offer (like a free trial or freemium plan). For others, the call to action may lead them to the product page or directly to the shopping cart. Whatever the case may be, make sure your call to action is clear and concise.

### 5. No "hard selling"

> This is the number one rule when it comes to pre-selling pages. Don’t be too pushy. Again, your goal is to educate the visitor on who you are, what you offer, and how your product solves their problem. Your visitors shouldn’t feel pressured into a sale.
